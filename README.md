android spotify client
ANDROID STUDIO

This is a project I've been working on with a friend of mine, Sam Britton. 
The idea is that we'll work with Spotify API to pull data from Spotify servers to create an electronic "jukebox"
type functionality, with several users on the same network being able to add songs they wish to hear to a queue and the 
songs being played from a remote location within the room or through all the devices connected, creating an dual purpose of
a public "mash" playlist or a jukebox.
